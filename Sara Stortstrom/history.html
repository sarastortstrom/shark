Sharks have been around for over 400 million years, making them one of the oldest species on Earth, even predating dinosaurs. They evolved in the oceans during the Devonian period and have survived multiple mass extinction events. Early sharks were smaller and less specialized, but over millions of years, they developed into the diverse species we see today. Fossil evidence shows that sharks have changed relatively little in structure, highlighting their successful adaptation to marine life. Today, there are over 500 species of sharks, ranging from the small dwarf lanternshark to the massive whale shark.
